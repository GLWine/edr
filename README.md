# EDR
ED Recon is an [EDMC](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/) plugin for [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) whose purpose is to warn you about other dangerous commanders and help bounty hunters chase them.

The repository is incomplete. It doesn't include dependencies like [EDMCOverlay](https://github.com/inorton/EDMCOverlay) nor the configuration info (e.g. API keys, hosts).

When the private beta ends, I will provide the packaged version of EDR including those additional files.
