; Top level "" allows you to set defaults for all channels
; Use specific channel names to override the defaults
;   - Channel names: "local", "starsystem", "squadron", "squadleaders", "wing", "crew", "player"
;
; Per cmdr options:
;   - defaults can be set with the empty name (e.g. ""). For instance, you can set "": { "blocked": true } to only forward messages from specific commanders by overriding the defaults (e.g. "Space Cabbage Omega": {"blocked": false})
;   - for specific players (e.g. blocking or hiding messages from a specific commander, etc.)
;
