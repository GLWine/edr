; This file is a sample
;  1. rename it to user_discord_players.json
;  2. remove all the comment lines (e.g. prefixed with ;)
;  3. modify its content to reflect your needs 
;   
; Use this to customize the discord integration:
;   - defaults by using the empty name (e.g. ""). For instance, you can set "": { "blocked": true } to only forward messages from specific commanders by overriding the defaults (e.g. "Space Cabbage Omega": {"blocked": false})
;   - for specific players (e.g. blocking or hiding messages from a specific commander, etc.)
;
; Note that some of the defaults (i.e. blocked, matching, mismatching, min_karma, max_karma) are ignored for the wing, crew, player (direct), squadron, and squadron leaders channels
;
