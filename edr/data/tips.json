    "OPEN tips": [
        "Never fly what you can't afford to lose. Check your rebuy and credit balance on your right panel.",
        "Never combat log in Open. If you aren't willing to accept the risk, don't bother with Open, Google 'Mobius PVE'.",
        "Hit Ctrl+B to display a bandwidth meter. You are not alone if it goes over 1000 B/s.",
        "Regularly check your contact history in the top panel for known threats.",
        "[Planet] Dismiss your ship immediately after boarding your SRV. Outlaws will destroy it in seconds otherwise.",

        "[Planet] For new discoveries, land a bit away from the area of interest and dismiss your ship asap.",
        "[Explorers] Don't trust anyone, check a contact's loadout in your left panel before banding to take selfies.",
        "[Explorers] On your trip back to the bubble, reach out to Iridium Wing for an escort.",
        "[Explorers] Throttle down to 0% when your jump completes to avoid bad surprises (e.g. neutron star, 2 stars close to each other)",

        "[Traders] Pledge for 4 weeks to Aisling Duval in order to get the stronger 'prismatic shields'.",

        "[Traders] Engineer prismatic shields with Reinforced, even resistance % with Augmented Resistance on your shield boosters.",
        "[Traders] Rares are special goods (e.g. Hutton Mug, Sothis Gold). The further you take them from where you buy them (up to 200ly) the more you get for them.",
        "[Suicide trap] At busy stations, stay below 100 m/s or you will get killed by the station for colliding into a 'suicide eagle'.",

        "[Station] The station fires back when hit. Use that to your advantage: stay close to the structure, chaff, etc.",
        "[Station] The no-fire zone is a misnomer: players can and will fire at you at the cost of small fine.",
        "[Escape] Bind a key/button to 'select next route' to quickly target your escape route.",
        "[Escape] It is safer and faster to jump to a different system (i.e. 'high waking' is not subject to mass lock).",

        "[Community Goal] Drop just before being interdicted, throttle to zero, charge your FSD, boost when the player shows up. Repeat.",
        "[Supercruise] Don't supercruise straight to the station, take a curve above the plane: faster and safer.",

        "[Combat] Put all 4 pips to SYS when being fired upon; move them where needed when not fired upon.",

        "[Combat] Double shield cell banking: fire first cell, wait for 90% heat, fire heat sink, when heat drops rapidly fire the second cell.",
        "[Combat] Railgun with feedback cascade can counter shield cell banking.",
        "[Combat] Best time to fire your shield cell is when you are at 1 / 1.5 ring and right in front of your opponent just as you are about to fly past them.",
        "[Interdicted] Put 4 pips to SYS, 2 to ENG and fly evasive. Hit next route and high wake asap, do not fly in a straight line.",

        "[Bounty hunting] If you see a pirate being shot at by cops while bounty hunting, make sure you finish scanning them before you open fire, or you will become wanted too.",
        "[Bounty hunting] Don't steal kills. Instead, ask to join a wing: everyone will get the same bounty and way faster.",
        "[Community] Most players are just nice folks. Chat with people, make friends. It might come handy.",
        "[Defense] Fit Point Defenses to your ship to destroy missiles and mines",
